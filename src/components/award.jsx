        </h2>

          The Navotsava Yatra was an inspiring journey where our team traveled
          across 76 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) in Uttar Pradesh to
          personally deliver invitations for the upcoming Navotsava celebration.
          This unique yatra was not only a way to formally invite alumni,
          teachers, and students but also to reconnect with the Navodaya
          community and rekindle the spirit of unity, collaboration, and pride
          among its members. Through each visit, the team engaged with school
          leaders, shared the vision for Navotsava, and encouraged participation
          in this event, which celebrates the achievements and contributions of
          Navodaya alumni. The journey embodied the Navodaya spirit, fostering a
          deep sense of connection and anticipation for the event, where past
          and present Navodayans can come together to share experiences, learn,
          and contribute towards futureÂ endeavors.
